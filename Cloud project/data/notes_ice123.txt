N1763465421ae2d|Cloud Computing|2025-11-18 17:00:21|Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, and software over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It allows users to access computing power and services from providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, eliminating the need to own and maintain physical hardware. This model provides flexibility, scalability, and cost savings by allowing users to pay only for the services they consume.
N176348491952be|Quantum physics|2025-11-18 22:25:19|Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level, describing a reality that operates differently from our everyday, macroscopic world. It explains phenomena like the wave-particle duality of light and matter, quantum superposition (where a particle can exist in multiple states at once), and quantum entanglement. This field emerged because classical physics couldn't explain certain observations, such as why heated gases emit specific lines of light. 
Key concepts
Quantization: Physical properties, like energy, don't change continuously but exist in discrete, specific amounts called "quanta".
Wave-particle duality: Particles like electrons and photons can behave as both waves and particles.
N17635281271f1e|Atomic research|2025-11-19 10:25:27|"Atomic research" can refer to either the scientific study of the atom and its nucleus or a methodology in user experience (UX) research for breaking down user data. Nuclear science research, exemplified by institutions like the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in India, focuses on nuclear energy, materials science, and isotope applications in agriculture and medicine. Atomic UX research, or "atomic research nuggets," involves dissecting user insights into their smallest, indivisible units to make data more manageable and reusable across projects.
