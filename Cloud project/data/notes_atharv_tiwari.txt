N1763407626b4aa|Dijkstra's algorithm|2025-11-18 00:57:06|Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph. It is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs, but a crucial constraint is that all edge weights must be non-negative. 
N176347659573a6|AI/ML|2025-11-18 20:06:35|AI/ML stands for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, where AI is the broader concept of machines mimicking human intelligence, and ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming. AI uses various methods to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, while ML uses statistical algorithms to find patterns in data to make predictions or decisions.
N17635279049e14|stem cell therapy|2025-11-19 10:21:44|Stem cell therapy is a medical treatment that uses stem cells, which can develop into many different cell types, to repair damaged or diseased tissues and organs. It works by using the stem cells' ability to divide and differentiate to replace damaged cells, promote tissue regeneration, and reduce inflammation. While it holds promise for various conditions, such as certain cancers and neurological or cardiovascular diseases, only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is FDA-approved for therapeutic use.
